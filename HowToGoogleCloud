# Detectron

Detectron is Facebook AI Research's software system that implements state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, including [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870). It is written in Python and powered by the [Caffe2](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2) deep learning framework.

At FAIR, Detectron has enabled numerous research projects, including: [Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144), [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870), [Detecting and Recognizing Human-Object Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07333), [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002), [Non-local Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07971), [Learning to Segment Every Thing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10370), [Data Distillation: Towards Omni-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04440), [DensePose: Dense Human Pose Estimation In The Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00434), and [Group Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08494).

## Introduction

The goal of Detectron is to provide a high-quality, high-performance
codebase for object detection *research*. It is designed to be flexible in order
to support rapid implementation and evaluation of novel research. Detectron
includes implementations of the following object detection algorithms:

- [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) -- *Marr Prize at ICCV 2017*
- [RetinaNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) -- *Best Student Paper Award at ICCV 2017*
- [Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497)
- [RPN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497)
- [Fast R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083)
- [R-FCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06409)

using the following backbone network architectures:

- [ResNeXt{50,101,152}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431)
- [ResNet{50,101,152}](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
- [Feature Pyramid Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144) (with ResNet/ResNeXt)
- [VGG16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)

Additional backbone architectures may be easily implemented. For more details about these models, please see [References](#references) below.
